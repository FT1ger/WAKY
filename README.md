`WAKY` - Will Ant Kill You

What is `WAKY`?
---------

`WAKY` is an R script (`.r`) or R markdown (`.rmd`) file checker. It only designed for the student who study in data taming in The University of Adelaide. Since students need to follow the **Deliverable Specifications** (DS), otherwise they can only get very few points, and then they can't pass this course.

To prevent this from happening again, after you finish your work, `WAKY` will automatically check both you R script and R markdown file, and print a report to remind you that will you got killed by a small mistake, just like an elephant got killed by an ant.

How to use WAKY?
----------------

- Download WAKY_windows.exe or WAKY_macOS.app from release.
- Run WAKY_windows.exe or WAKY_macOS.app.
- Select your R file and Rmd file.
- If everything is fine, you will see the generated report `.log` files.

What will `WAKY` do?
--------------

- **Check Deliverable Specifications**

**Deliverable Specifications**(DS) is the mainly reason why you lose your mark in this course. For each DS, you will lost 20% of marks. `DS checker` in `WAKY` will check each DS for you code and list where is the mistake.

- **Check commands you use**

You can only use commands, packages from the course, otherwise you will lose you marks for the question. `Commands checker` in `WAKY` will check all the commands you use and compare them with the reminder sheet.

- **Print the report**

After `WAKY` finished checking, it will print a report of the result.
